Due to the fact that there is not yet a Spigot repository, I am unable to use Maven. To contribute, clone the repository and download and add the following dependencies to your project:

- Spigot 1.8
- WorldEdit
- Multiverse-Core
- Vault

Then you will be free to add and submit pull requests! Thanks in advance!
