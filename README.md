# Prison 3
Prison is a powerful Bukkit plugin that includes the basics for creating a Prison server. There are over 25 features
from 6 main features, with support for extensions to expand functionality even further. This is definitely the only Prison plugin you'll ever need.

## What about Prison 2.x.x versions?
Prison 2 has been around for over a year and the bug reports are just too many. In fact, Prison 2 bug reports went up to 72 issues in the last few months! That's definitely a sign that something's wrong. DMP9Software, while they were maintaining the project while I was away, created a Prison 3 version, but now that I'm back, I want to do it my way.

## When will it be released?
Prison 3 has 32 planned classes, and a lot of logic goes into all of those classes. [You can find the full plans here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zkfzoeu4nsu29ik/Prison%203%20Plans.pdf?dl=0) (Please excuse my awful handwriting.)
